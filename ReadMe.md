# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The goal is to build a simple, interpretable machine learning model that can assist in early diagnosis and support clinical decision-making.

# 📌 Problem Statement

Heart disease is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Detecting it early can lead to timely intervention and save lives. This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease using features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.
